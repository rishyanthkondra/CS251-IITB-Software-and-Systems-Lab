      Added O1.txt to master
command used for rebase
git rebase master
git rebase --skip(Command used to skip)
git checkout master
git merge feature1

YES , we got conflicts because we edited demo.txt in both master and feature and we didn't make changes to that in feature

There are no merge commits in the log because merge commits are just commits with more than one parent but we didn't merge the branch directly while rebasing recursively applies the existng commits to the parent .
